## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, Ejs, MongoDb, Bootstrap and Cyclic.

This is a Full-stack, responsive web app, made with MongoDb, Express, Ejs and Node, with BootStrap to improve on the looks and speed of the css. Taylor fit to my needs and the needs of the work i needed to do.

## Optimizations

There is a lot of things to improve, or things i am currently working on, like new features, specially when working with the data and exporting it to excel.
I would also like, in the near future, to use react instead of bootstrap just to make it look more unique

## Lessons Learned:

Learned a lot about Full stack apps, how does a css framework works, how to export data to a spread sheet, overall how to make a functional app to fulfill the needs that i had.
